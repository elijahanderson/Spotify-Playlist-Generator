# Spotify Playlist Generator

Given a song or band name, this program creates a spotify playlist with similar music.

If you are a music fan like myself, you've probably run into a dead end of fresh jams to listen to at some
point in your listening career. The focus of this small program will be finding new and relatively obscure
artists that are tangentially related to whatever input you give the program and forming a decent-sized
playlist from their songs.

It will be developed using Python 3 with the PyCharm Community IDE.
